# housing-price-prediction
Machine learning project to predict house prices using regression techniques, focusing on data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model evaluation.

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression techniques.
It demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature encoding,
model training, and performance evaluation.

## Dataset
Structured housing dataset containing numerical and categorical features related
to residential properties.

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

## Results
Linear models provided baseline performance, while Random Forest significantly
improved predictions by capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature importance analysis
- Advanced ensemble models
